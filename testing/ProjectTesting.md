# Project Testing
## Test Plan
Methodology:
 - There are 6 testers in total that are members from group 10
 - The purpose of the test is to mainly observing the behavior of the testers and see if there are any confusion during the process
 - Optionally we are also making sure all the core functions are functioning as expected

Script/task:
 - T1 – Using the sidebar, navigate throughout the app
 - T2 – Run through the tutorial
 - T3 – View your profile
 - T4 – Change your username and tags
 - T5 – Sign up for an event
 - T6 – Join a group
 - T7 – Check what events you’ve signed up for
 - T8 – Check which groups you’ve joined
 - T9 – Check your notifications
 - T10 – Check the messages in a group you’ve joined
 - T11 – Check how many seats are remaining in a group you’ve joined
 - T12 – Scan a poster
 - T13 – Change the colour scheme of the app

Roles: (need help here)
 - Jeremiah - Prototype main developer, testing navigator
 - Jack - Prototype main developer, testing navigator
 - Trung Nhan(trannhan) - Flexible protype developer, flexible report writer
 - Lilian - Main report writer
 - Andrija - Prototype designer

Metrics: (need help here)

Usability Goals: (since metrics is empty, should be improved when metrics are finished)
 - The testers have no problems navigating the basic and core functions and give positive feed back aethestic wise

Problem Severity:
 - All the problems that our group has observed after the testing are mostly design flaws that bear very little consequences to the overall
 experiences of the whole design
 - When encountering said problems the users are only slightly confused and able to quickly overcome after given a short amount of time, mostly due
 to having difficulties intrepreting the functionality of some of the buttons
## Results (This is the 7th part of the requirement, in this part I was unable to comprehend the second point of the requirement so that needs improvement/completion)
Generally, feedback was focused into a few areas:
-	The snack menu should always be accessible
-	A distinction between the “Discover” page and the “My groups”/”My events” pages
-	The tutorial should be easier to access and should be automatically displayed on first use.
-	The burger menu button should be replaced by a back button when the user is on a sub page

## Discussion
There are many interesting feedback we have received during the testings,
among those we narrowed it down into 2 most crucial, interesting and major
points

### 1/
The first one is that many testers pointed out that they prefer the bottom
tools bar that contains the tutorial button to be available more constantly,
especially on the "home" page of the prototype. Even if they aren't they
should be more accessible rather than only show up when side bar is activated.
A suggestion was made for it to be hidden until scrolled all the way down the
screen

While most of us(the developer side) agree on this insight most of the
testers also point out that this is mainly their personal opinion or preference
and there are also testers who had no problems with the current way but
still think it's a good idea if the tutorial button is more highligted.

### 2/
The second feedback and the more crucial opinion is the confusion of the
button "my groups/events" and "explore". The "explore" will take the user
to a screen where they can choose new events/groups to join and 
"my groups/events" are for added/joined events/groups. A solution that
we managed to discussed with the testers and receive favorable feedback
is to include the "explore" button in the "my groups/events" respectively
and the user can choose between the adding and viewing joined group in
each perspective page. The design will be similar to the current "explore"
screen as they already have the options of switching between events and groups
in the same page.
