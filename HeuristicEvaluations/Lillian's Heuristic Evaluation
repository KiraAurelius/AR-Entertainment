The following 4 designs will be judged using the 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design:
#1: Visibility of system status
#2: Match between system and the real world
#3: User control and freedom
#4: Consistency and standards
#5: Error prevention
#6: Recognition rather than recall
#7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
#8: Aesthetic and minimalist design
#9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
#10: Help and documentation

Each heuristic of the design will be rated 1 to 10.
Furthermore, the 4 designs will be rated against 3 points:
1:	Standards and familiarity
How familiar and easy to understand the system is. how quick the user can
understand the system's functions. 
Summarizes heuristic 2, 4 and 6.

2:	User usage and efficiency.
	How little of a headache users get and how user friendly it feels.
	Summarizes heuristic 1, 5, 7, 9 and 10.

3:	Aesthetic
	The minimalism and simplicity of the design.
	Summarizes heuristic 3 and 8.

View /Create 3D models over select poster in VR.

Visibility of system status	3/10
System Device is generally not provided within the application/UI


Match between system and the real world	9/10
UI Has good use of easily recognizable symbols	


User control and freedom	7/10	
User is easily able to navigate between various states

Consistency and standards	8/10
All aspects of the application and UI follow consistent design methods	

Error prevention	8/10
System is designed in such a way, as to be extremely simple, and therefore errors are unlikely
	
Recognition rather than recall	 9/10
UI is clear and easily readable, nothing is too small, nor is there anything that feels cramped	

Flexibility and efficiency of use	6/10
While generally the app is easy and simple to navigate, it may be a good idea to have a greater number of shortcuts to make navigation easier	

Aesthetic and minimalist design	10/10	
UI is kept extremely simplistic to prioritize what the user wants to see, making the information easily accessible 

Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors	N/A/10	
Not necessary, due to errors likely being extremely rare

Help and documentation	10/10 	
Both sides (Dev + User) have their own help pages, along with tutorials being accessible when needed.


Summary in three points:
1:	Standards and familiarity	9/10
2:	User's usage and efficiency.	7/10
3:	Aesthetic.			9/10

integrating embedded AR systems to the university lecture system.
help students manage themselves.

Visibility of system status	7/10
System status is accessible via a menu, however this is not always accessible 


Match between system and the real world	10/10	
Uses familiar symbology, as well as terminology known by most people, rather than jargon.

User control and freedom	8/10	
User is able to navigate via the navigation menu, however this is the only method of navigation.

Consistency and standards	10/10	
UI design is consistent across the application, with all design choices being in line with best practice.

Error prevention   4/10
Does not seem to have a way to delete/edit groups or messages after they have been created/sent	

Recognition rather than recall	 10/10
The different states are clearly labeled and indicated, meaning the user is not forcer to remember which button corresponds to which state.	

Flexibility and efficiency of use	9/10	
Users are, in most cases, able to quickly access what they need, as well as navigate to different states in a clear and consistent manner.

Aesthetic and minimalist design	10/10	
Design, layout and palette are consistent across the application

Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors	1/10	
No error messages for bad input (I.e not allowed group name)

Help and documentation	1/10 	
No tutorials are provided to help the user learn to navigate the app


Summary in three points:
1:	Standards and familiarity	9/10
2:	User's usage and efficiency.	6/10
3:	Aesthetic.			7/10

Jeremiah Choi 	300474835 
Strategy/Tactics AR-powered game

Visibility of system status	10/10
The states are clearly represented on-screen.

Match between system and the real world	8/10	
Generally, any symbols/terminology used is widely familiar and likely known to the user, however some game jargon is used.

User control and freedom	10/10	
User is able to easily navigate through menus, as well as return to the previous screen via a back button

Consistency and standards	9/10	
UI matches similar games of the type, as well as having a consistent design style.

Error prevention	7/10	
While it is difficult to gauge what sort of errors could occur, the existence of a back button helps to mitigate accidental button presses.

Recognition rather than recall		9/10	
All buttons are clearly labelled with text and images, making them recognizable, as well as easily being able to tell what they do.

Flexibility and efficiency of use	2/10	
User cannot really alter the layout of the UI in any way

Aesthetic and minimalist design	8/10	
Due to the applications nature, minimalism is hard to achieve, however, the UI is no cluttered, and UI items are kept to what is necessary only.

Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors	6/10	
We are able to see an error message for one situation, however we cannot know about others

Help and documentation	1/10 	
The user is not presented a tutorial, which is commonplace for this type of game.


Summary in three points:
1:	Standards and familiarity	9/10
2:	User's usage and efficiency.	3/10
3:	Aesthetic.			9/10

Imbedding and integration of AR elements into university advertising material

Visibility of system status	9/10
It is clearly indicated by UI elements what state the user is currently in, as well as by buttons


Match between system and the real world	8/10	
In general, highly familiar symbology and UI text is used, however some jargon is used.

User control and freedom	10/10	
High number of navigational features, with back buttons, navigation menus, as well as a search bar

Consistency and standards	10/10	
UI design is applied consistently, as well as information regarding states remaining consistent.

Error prevention	10/10

Recognition rather than recall		10/10	
All elements are clearly labelled with text as well as images, making them easily recognizable.

Flexibility and efficiency of use	10/10	
Interface is kept to a minimum, which, alongside the large amount of navigation features, makes interfacing with the app extremely easy and efficient.

Aesthetic and minimalist design	9/10	
Design is applied consistently, and UI is not overcrowded.

Detailed error screens are always given

Help and documentation	10/10 	
A clear and concise tutorial is given to the user.


Summary in three points:
