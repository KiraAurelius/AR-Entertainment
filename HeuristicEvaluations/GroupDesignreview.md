# SWEN303 Group Project Part 1 Heuristic evaluation overview.

## Project 1 (Nhan Tran)
As a group, we felt that project one generally had extremely high levels of familiarity and use of consistent and standard symbology. Such as utilizing clear and consistent design, as well as using familiar symbols in place of words (Where applicable.) However, we felt that the general usability and efficiency of the project could have been prioritized more, with a lack of error solving features being the largest issue in this aspect. As well as potentially adding a greater number of shortcuts with which to move between states. Although, due to the small number of states this may not be as much of an issue. Aesthetically this project was extremely well designed, with consistent use of design conventions as well as consistent application of symbology and colour, leading to a project that looks cohesive and professional.

### Summary in three points:
1:	Standards and familiarity	    9/10
2:	User's usage and efficiency.	7/10
3:	Aesthetic.			            8/10

## Project 2 (Andrija Djorovic)
We found this project to have extremely high level of consistent design, as well as a great use of familiar design and symbols to add some inherent familiarity and reduce the learning curve a new user is faced with. Symbols, abbreviations, and keywords are used to aid the user in navigating, as well as design that fits with other applications of the same type. In terms of usage and efficiency, we also find a lack of error prevention/handling tools to be the biggest issue with the project, with now way to edit classes once created, as well as nothing in the way of error messages. The app also provides no tutorials which may make it slightly more difficult for a new user to learn. However, aesthetically, the app has an extremely consistent design that again falls in line with other apps in the same market, making it enjoyable and familiar to use, while being pleasing to the eye.

### Summary in three points:
1:	Standards and familiarity	    10/10
2:	User's usage and efficiency.	5/10
3:	Aesthetic.			            8/10

## Project 3 (Lillian Hide-Tobin)
Overall, the standards and familiarity of this project were generally high, with the usage of symbols in place of words where possible, as well as a design that is consistent with other apps of the same type. One area in which this could have been improved is ensuring that all aspects are consistent with common design practices, such as having all buttons in the places where they would normally be found. In terms of usage and efficiency this project was overall good, however the addition of further tutorials/documentation may have been useful, as well as ensuring that the tutorial is shown to the user on first launch. System status could also be more visible. Aesthetically, this project matches extremely well with other university services, and has a high level of both internal and external consistency.

### Summary in three points:
1:	Standards and familiarity.		    8/10
2:	User's usage and efficiency.		7/10
3:	Aesthetic.				            8/10


## Project 4  (Jeremiah Choi)
This project again had an extremely high level of adherence to design standards, as well as good use of familiar symbols/terminology. One potential area this could have even further been improved is reducing some of the jargon used or providing an explanation of its meaning. In terms of the userâ€™s interface with the game, the project is overall successful at creating an easily navigable project, however some areas could do with improvement. For one, including a greater number of shortcuts, or a way in which to modify the UI (Perhaps by hiding/showing UI elements) may have been useful. There is also no tutorial provided, which, for such a complicated app, may leave some users unable to interact with the app in the way they seek to. Aesthetically, this project has an extremely unique look, while still adhering to enough of the genres design conventions to remain familiar, while also having a high level of internal consistency in terms of its design language. 

### Summary in three points:
1:	Standards and familiarity	    8/10
2:	User's usage and efficiency.	5/10
3:	Aesthetic.			            8/10


## Project 5 (Jack Rodgers)
Overall, this project again had a great use of familiar symbols and terminology, making the project immediately more accessible, by making the interface approachable and familiar. The only potential may be the use of some jargon, which could confuse some users if they are unfamiliar with the terminology. This project also provides an extremely high level of usability, with clear error screens, easily accessible documentation/tutorials, as well as providing solutions to any errors that may arise, making for a smooth experience, even if the user does run into problems. In terms of aesthetic, this project is extremely consistent with itself, with the chosen design being applied clearly across all aspects of the design, while ensuring that the design remained minimalistic and un-bloated.

### Summary in three points:
1:	Standards and familiarity	    9/10
2:	User's usage and efficiency.	9/10
3:	Aesthetic.			            10/10
