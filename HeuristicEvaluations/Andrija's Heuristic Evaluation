The following 4 designs will be judged using the 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design:
#1: Visibility of system status
#2: Match between system and the real world
#3: User control and freedom
#4: Consistency and standards
#5: Error prevention
#6: Recognition rather than recall
#7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
#8: Aesthetic and minimalist design
#9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
#10: Help and documentation

Each heuristic of the design will be rated 1 to 10.
Furthermore, the 4 designs will be rated against 3 points:
1:	Standards and familiarity
How familiar and easy to understand the system is. how quick the user can
understand the system's functions. 
Summarizes heuristic 2, 4 and 6.

2:	User usage and efficiency.
	How little of a headache users get and how user friendly it feels.
	Summarizes heuristic 1, 5, 7, 9 and 10.

3:	Aesthetic
	The minimalism and simplicity of the design.
	Summarizes heuristic 3 and 8.

View /Create 3D models over select poster in VR.

Visibility of system status	4/10
System Device is generally not provided within the application/UI

Match between system and the real world	9/10
good use of easily recognizable symbols	

User control and freedom	7/10	
easy navigation between states

Consistency and standards	9/10
All aspects of the application and UI follow consistent design methods	

Error prevention	8/10
With a simple design, errors are unlikely
	
Recognition rather than recall	 10/10
clear and easily readable UI

Flexibility and efficiency of use	5/10
Yes the system is easily navigated, but would be good to have more shortcuts

Aesthetic and minimalist design	10/10	
With a simplistic UI, all the information is easily readable

Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors	5/10	
Not covered, but not nessesery as well

Help and documentation	10/10 	
Both Dev and User have their own help pages, as well as tutorials being accessible


Summary in three points:
1:	Standards and familiarity	9/10
2:	User's usage and efficiency.	7/10
3:	Aesthetic.			8/10

AR advertisement.

Visibility of system status	6/10	
No on System Device, however is easily deciphered

Match between system and the real world	9/10
Clear and simple labels, and a tutorial helps for people unfamiliar with the system

User control and freedom	10/10	
easy access to states and fixing unwanted actions with the return button

Consistency and standards	8/10	
Follows consistency, with some minor changes in design

Error prevention	9/10	
states have a small posabilities of errors

Recognition rather than recall		10/10	
everything is easily available to the user, exept in camera mode(expected)

Flexibility and efficiency of use	6/10 	
No shortcuts except the bottom bar.

Aesthetic and minimalist design	8/10	
minimalist and prioritizes the systems content of the given state

Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors	6/10	
Error when a failed screen happens

Help and documentation	8/10	
tutorials being accessible at all times. 

Summary in three points:
1:	Standards and familiarity.		9/10
2:	User's usage and efficiency.		9/10
3:	Aesthetic.				7/10

Jeremiah Choi 	300474835 
Strategy/Tactics AR-powered game

Visibility of system status	10/10
The states are clearly represented on-screen.

Match between system and the real world	7/10	
The symbols and terminology is familiar and known the targer user, however not to the major public.

User control and freedom	10/10	
easy access to states and returning ot previus state with the back button

Consistency and standards	10/10	
System uses game standers, as well as a consistent design

Error prevention	6/10	
With a complicated system, such as a game, errors are common, a back buttot helps quite a lot atleast.

Recognition rather than recall		9/10	
Clear a simple labels with text and images, its intuitive what they do

Flexibility and efficiency of use	3/10	
UI is fixed and non flexiable, exept the back button

Aesthetic and minimalist design	8/10	
UI only shows what is necessary at the given state, whitch is all you could ask for in a game system.

Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors	6/10
We have a example of an error, however it with the given system, we can exept more kinds or errors

Help and documentation	1/10 	
No tutorial or help page


Summary in three points:
1:	Standards and familiarity	8/10
2:	User's usage and efficiency.	4/10
3:	Aesthetic.			9/10
