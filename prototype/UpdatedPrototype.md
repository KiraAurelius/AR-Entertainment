### Tutorial
It now appears on the first login to help the user understand the app's content, as well as having the order of slides changed in case the user installed the app just to scan a poster.

### Find Groups/Events

Almost all of the testers had a problem with the explore page and its separation from the my events/groups pages. The explore page has been removed, and events and groups now have a single page each, with tabs to switch between looking for new events, or groups, and looking through those you've already joined. This eliminates the confusion caused by the explore page entirely and allows the user to quickly identify where to find new groups and events. Furthermore, it simplifies the navigational map of the app, reducing the important core features of the app down to three core pages.

### New Snack Bar

The snack bar, which was only accessable from opening the burger menu, is now accessable from all three core pages. The contents within the snack bar has been replaced, it now links the user to the three core pages of the app. This changes the snack bar's purpose in the app, where it now serves as the users primary navigational tool. During testing, users were irritated that they had to open the burger menu to access a different core page. Now, the users are able to quickly jump from one core page to the next with ease. However, it is unavailable within non-core pages that are accessed through the burger menu.

### Burger Menu

The burger menu serves to hide it's contents until it is opened. Since the contents of the snack bar have been replaced with links to the three core pages, the previously linked non-core pages were moved into the burger menu. We feel this change is most relevant as the four pages were not as important as the three core pages, and thus should be hidden to the side appropriately. This also simplifies navigation further, as all non-core pages are to be primarily accessed via the burger menu.

### Back Arrows

During testing, users were confused with the placement of the back arrow, as well as its infrequent appearances. Now, all non-core pages has a back arrow in place of the burger menu. We feel this change makes the most sense as the expected way of accessing these pages are from the burger menu, a back arrow should represent a return to it. Furthermore, these non-core pages are all navigational dead-ends, meaning they do not, and should not, contain a link to another feature of the app. (IE: you should not be able to access the settings page via the notifications page). 
This will reduce the confusion users displayed during testing, by keeping everything in one place.
