### New Snack Bar

The snack bar, which was previously only available from the burger menu, has been added to all core pages and its selection has been changed to the core pages. This change was made because users had to always do two presses to navigate between core pages, and this makes the process quicker and easier for new users to understand. The original burger menu only snack bar was also difficult for testees to understand, but removing it would result in too many burger menu options, so the new snack bar was a good compromise. The snack bar is only displayed on core pages, with pages that do not have it being either pages that the user would only be on briefly and can back out of, or pages where having more screen real estate makes sense, like the view event pages.

### Back Arrows

Because some testees were confused with the placement of the back arrow in our tests, as well as its infrequent appearances, non-core pages now have a back arrow in place of the burger menu. It now appears on pages where the user has a state to return to, as well as pages where the user would not spend the majority of their time. This reduces overall confusion and makes the app more understandable.

### Find Groups/Events

Almost all of the testers had a problem with the explore page and its separation from the my events/groups pages. The explore page has been removed, and events and groups now have a single page each, with tabs to switch between looking for new events/groups and looking through those you've already signed up for/joined. This eliminates the confusion caused by the explore page entirely and allows the user to quickly identify where to find new groups and events. Works well with the new snack bar as well.

### Burger Menu

(Awful sentence below here.)
With the removal of the original snack bar and the addition of the contents of the old burger menu to the new snack bar, the new burger menu now consists of the contents of the old snack bar, or the non core pages. During testing, testees had a hard time finding the tutorial on the snack bar and understanding the icons of the snack bar, so having them just listed in the burger menu instead helps cut down on that confusion, while still having the options tucked away as theyâ€™re not as frequent as the core pages.

### Tutorial
It now appears on the first login to help the user understand the app's content, as well as having the order of slides changed in case the user installed the app just to scan one poster or something.
