### Login screen:
<img src="Images/screens/loginscreen.png"  width="20%" height="20%">
<img src="Images/screens/loginkeyboardscreen.png"  width="20%" height="20%">

A straightforward app login screen. Allows users to stay logged in and quickly reset their password. Uses the keyobard of the operating system on which the app is running.

### Home page:
<img src="Images/screens/homescreen.png"  width="20%" height="20%">

The home pages allows the user to quickly access more important information. The calendar section displays upcoming event dates for the current month. The messages tab displays the most recently received messages from the users' group chats. The notifications tab displays a condensed version of the user's event notifications. Each tab can be hidden away so that the user can ignore aspects of the app that they are not using, such as if they have never joined any groups.

### Topbar & Burger Menu:
<img src="Images/screens/sidebar.png"  width="20%" height="20%">

The topbar appears on all pages of the app and contains context-sensitive buttons such as a back or search button as needed. The burger menu button is available on all pages, allowing users to quickly navigate to the page they want.

The burger menu is the primary means of navigation for users throughout the app. It lists the app's main pages so the user can quickly access them. Because the features on the bottom bar are less likely to be used frequently by the user, they are represented by application standard icons rather then being listed like the others.

### My profile pages:
<img src="Images/screens/myprofilescreen.png"  width="20%" height="20%">
<img src="Images/screens/editporiflescreen.png"  width="20%" height="20%">

The my profile pages allow users to view and set their interests for other aspects of the app, as well as other user information such as name and profile picture.

### Explore Pages:
The explore pages are where users can learn about engineering events and groups. The page is divided into three tabs.

<img src="Images/screens/exploreventsscreen.png"  width="20%" height="20%">
<img src="Images/screens/vieweventsceen.png"  width="20%" height="20%">

The events tab displays the user's upcoming events, sorted by month, and includes the date of the event in the poster's corner. Poster images are used to entice users to attend the events and to match scanned in posters. Scrolling down the page will take you through the months, while scrolling across will take you through the events of that month. Tapping an event brings up its card, which contains additional information about the event, such as where it is and how many seats are available.

<img src="Images/screens/exploregroupsscreen.png"  width="20%" height="20%">
<img src="Images/screens/viewgroupscreen.png"  width="20%" height="20%">

The groups tab is similar to the events tab, but it displays groups sorted by the tags they've assigned to them. When you tap a group, you will be taken to the group page, where you can join and view the group messages.

<img src="Images/screens/exploreinterestsscreen.png"  width="20%" height="20%">

The interests tab combines the events and groups tabs, filtering all available events and groups based on the tags the user has specified on their profile.

### My events page:
<img src="Images/screens/myeventsscreen.png"  width="20%" height="20%">

The my events page, similar to the explore page about events, allows users to see what events they've signed up for and read more about them, sorted by the months theyâ€™re happening.

### My groups page:
<img src="Images/screens/mygroupsscreen.png"  width="20%" height="20%">

The my groups page, similar to the explore page about groups, allows users to see what groups they've joined up and send messages to them, sorted by their tags. The group messages page allows users to chat and send information to one another.

### Notifications page:
<img src="Images/screens/notificationsscreen.png"  width="20%" height="20%">

Displays the notifications that the user has received. Because the notifications would be pushed to the user's phone OS as well, it isn't as prominently accessible as the other pages.

### QR Scan page:
<img src="Images/screens/scanscreen.png"  width="20%" height="20%">

A straightforward page that displays the camera on the user's phone, which can then be used to scan an affiliated poster. When scanned, the event page for the event advertised on the poster will appear.

### Tutorial/Setup pages:
<img src="Images/screens/tutorial2.png"  width="20%" height="20%">
<img src="Images/screens/tutorialone.png"  width="20%" height="20%">
<img src="Images/screens/tutorialIII.png"  width="20%" height="20%">

A set of tutorial pages for the app, which would have video demonstrations in place of the stock photos for whatever the slide is educating the user on. It can take the user to the relevant area of the app the tutorial is teaching, as well as being entirely skippable for experienced users. The pages would be forced on the user the first time they opened the app, but they would be accessible at any time by tapping the question mark in the burger menu afterwards.

### Settings page:
<img src="Images/screens/settingsscreen.png"  width="20%" height="20%">

Allows the user to change the colour scheme of the app, which isn't available in the prototype. In the future, users would also have the option of deleting their account or logging out, and other similar options.
