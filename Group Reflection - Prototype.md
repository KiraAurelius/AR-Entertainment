# Group Reflection
## Reflection on the merging of the designs
 - AR entertainment is a board idea and concept and during assignment one and two we were given a lof of freedom so each of our group members designs and themes were very different from each other. Ranging from video game to 3D developing tools and systems that support student's studies and course works.
 - However there are two designs that were common themed enough as they are both supporting the daily lives and works of a university student we decided on merging the said two projects.
 - As we work on the project it is become more and more transparent that rather than merging it's more akin to fixing and completing a design and tape on some ideas from other projects rather than a complete merge of different projects. We mainly used Andrija's project as a base.
 - The main goal of the design we are creating is to created a generalized system that helps student manage and keep track of a range of different information and work loads, for example schedules, deadlines and events.

## Best and worst part of the prototype
### Best parts:
 - The best parts of the prototype we cobbled up was the interaction we demonstrated
with the many features this app should be offering.
 - We feel that it best
shows (or at the very least implies) enough so that the imaginary client
will get a feel of what the final product will do.
### Worst parts:
 - Due to time constraint and some design issues many of the functionalities are not very indepth.
 - This include a lack of text field, saving capabilities - for example the edit page is merely implied and is impossible to do any memory editing like saving using AdobeXD as our choice of tools for creating the prototype.
