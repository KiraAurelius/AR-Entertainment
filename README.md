# SWEN303 2020 Final Project - Part 1 Prototyping - AR Entertain 1

# Background
## **Introduction**

### _Description_

AREntertain is a Education Management nonprofit organisation with the focus of the introduction of AR and VR technology for the next generation of tertiary students. With a mixture of educational and social activities, it tries to help future students with practical and real-world examples of various subjects. AREntertain is run with the help of Victoria University and other tertiary education providers. 

Offering lectures from tertiary educators and working professionals who will show and educate the participants. Also creating groups for like-minded students to share their knowledge and learn together. Using the tool to manage your groups and lectures that you want to participate in. They can also use the tool to manage and view your interests and timetable of all the lectures and events, and ask questions to the organizers and lecturers.

AREntertain is a multi-week program that ends with a big exhibition showcasing interactive industry examples and university projects. Participants will be encouraged to collaborate with others and tutors to create a small project. Participants who have created project groups are also able to showcase their work at the exhibition.

The program is co-run with the organizers of Summer of Tech.

### _Business Objectives_

Some students have trouble deciding what to study and giving them practical examples and lectures will help them decide if software engineering is what they want to study. Giving people who still have not decided what they want to study an opportunity to listen in on a few lectures and see if they are interested in the topics. AREntertain objective is to educate and inspire future engineers. Inspiring them with university projects worked on by students during summer scholarships and possibilities of working summer internships in the industry with the partnership with Summer of Tech. 

Another objective is to introduce the use of AR to people who have never used the technology. Giving the participants AR experience at lectures and the exhibition.

The tool should be easy and simple to use, as is to help make participation in the program easier and connecting like-minded students. The tool should also be as efficient as possible for lecturers and tutors so more time can be spent teaching material to students.

### _Importance to Stakeholders_

AREntertain will be a vital program for inspiring future engineers. It will give students an understanding of where the industry is at the moment and where it is heading, and giving them the support they need to see if they are interested in studying software engineering. Having support from the industry leaders in VR/AR in New Zealand and Summer of Tech, AREntertain will help create the necessary engagement of interest.
