### this is a draft

Two tests:
Test 1 – Perform a preliminary testing phase on two of the testees, ensuring that the test questions cover all of the app's content.
Test 2 – Conduct a second round of testing on the remaining testees, adding questions that cover content that was missing in the first test.

Give the testee a rundown of the application before running the tests; don't visually demo it, but explain what it is and its purpose.

Ask the testee to describe their thought process aloud while performing tasks.

After they have completed each test task, ask the testee what they thought of the process and how difficult it was to complete that task.

After test 1, ask the testee if they have a thorough understanding of how to use the app.
If they don't, find out which parts they don't understand and add additional questions about those parts for test 2.

Instead of telling users where to go to find what they need to do, record the steps they took to find x. Keep track of how long it took them to find them.

Look out for any moments where they do unconsciously do something(such as navigating to the home notifications) - These indicate where we chose well for the designs.

Also lookout for any moments where they look uncomfortable, annoyed/frustrated or confused. - These indicate where the designs failed.
