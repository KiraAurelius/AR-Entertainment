The following 4 designs will be judged using the 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design:
#1: Visibility of system status
#2: Match between system and the real world
#3: User control and freedom
#4: Consistency and standards
#5: Error prevention
#6: Recognition rather than recall
#7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
#8: Aesthetic and minimalist design
#9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
#10: Help and documentation

Each heuristic of the design will be rated 1 to 10.
Furthermore, the 4 designs will be rated against 3 points:
1:    Standards and familiarity
How familiar and easy to understand the system is. how quick the user can
understand the system's functions. 
Summarizes heuristic 2, 4 and 6.

2:    User usage and efficiency.
    How little of a headache users get and how user friendly it feels.
    Summarizes heuristic 1, 5, 7, 9 and 10.

3:    Aesthetic
    The minimalism and simplicity of the design.
    Summarizes heuristic 3 and 8.

Aesthetic and minimalist design    8/10    
Very minimalistic. very simple.

Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors    6/10    
Not much needed, provides a help page.

Help and documentation    10/10    
Not much needed, provides a help page.

Summary in three points:
1:    Standards and familiarity.        8/10
