The following 4 designs will be judged using the 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design:
#1: Visibility of system status
#2: Match between system and the real world
#3: User control and freedom
#4: Consistency and standards
#5: Error prevention
#6: Recognition rather than recall
#7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
#8: Aesthetic and minimalist design
#9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
#10: Help and documentation

Each heuristic of the design will be rated 1 to 10.
Furthermore, the 4 designs will be rated against 3 points:
1:	Standards and familiarity
How familiar and easy to understand the system is. how quick the user can
understand the system's functions. 
Summarizes heuristic 2, 4 and 6.

2:	User usage and efficiency.
	How little of a headache users get and how user friendly it feels.
	Summarizes heuristic 1, 5, 7, 9 and 10.

3:	Aesthetic
	The minimalism and simplicity of the design.
	Summarizes heuristic 3 and 8.

AR advertisement.

Visibility of system status	6/10	
The current mode can be deciphered from what's on-screen, but no label to indicate so. Hard to differentiate home from scanned.

Match between system and the real world	9/10
Uses clear and short language for navigational bar, the tutorial provides visual guidance for those who can’t understand the jargon.

User control and freedom	10/10	
Users can easily return to previous states and undo unwanted actions with the permanently available return button.

Consistency and standards	7/10	
Follows external consistency with top and bottom navigation bars, though return buttons are usually at the bottom.

Error prevention	8/10	
Not many states where errors can occur.

Recognition rather than recall		9/10	
All options available to the user at all times without being hidden away, except when a mode is in use.

Flexibility and efficiency of use	6/10 	
No shortcuts except the bottom bar.

Aesthetic and minimalist design	8/10	
Very minimalist and prioritizes the content on screen, whether camera feed or text.

Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors	6/10	
Error messages for when scanning fails but not much else.

Help and documentation	7/10	
The tutorial is always accessible, but not present when required eg on the first-time launch.

Summary in three points:
1:	Standards and familiarity.		8/10
2:	User's usage and efficiency.		7/10
3:	Aesthetic.				9/10

View /Create 3D models over select poster in VR.

Visibility of system status	4/10
System status is visible more by the device it’s on rather than the UI itself.

Match between system and the real world	8/10	
Most of the UI uses common symbols in place of words

User control and freedom	7/10	
Users can easily return to previous states via the leave button.

Consistency and standards	8/10	
Both the developer and end-user varients of the system follow

Error prevention	8/10	
The system is very simple and only has 1 or 2 states overall, so it’s unlikely to get errors.

Recognition rather than recall		10/10	
All UI elements are visible to the user at once. All are of good size and easily visible.

Flexibility and efficiency of use	4/10	
Applying more to the dev UI than the user, it doesn’t have any shortcuts where it probably could.

Aesthetic and minimalist design	10/10	
UI is simple and clean, and prioritizes the content view as much as possible, even giving the ability to hide UI options.

Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors	1/10	
 Not covered by the system.

Help and documentation	8/10 	
Both the dev and the user UI’s have help pages. Also, has tutorials presented when required.

Summary in three points:
1:	Standards and familiarity	9/10
2:	User's usage and efficiency.	5/10
3:	Aesthetic.			9/10

integrating embedded AR systems to the university lecture system.
help students manage themselves.

Visibility of system status	8/10
System status is visible in the burger menu, but this is hidden away at times. Other states are labeled but not consistently.

Match between system and the real world	10/10	
Uses small keywords and abbreviations where full terminology might confuse a user.

User control and freedom	7/10	
Users can easily switch between menus with the burger menu, but no dedicated back button.

Consistency and standards	9/10	
My groups and groups are too similar. Asides from this menus are consistent and follow industry standards for things like messaging, scrolling, and dropdowns.

Error prevention	5/10	
Slips could be made when making groups, needs an edit button.

Recognition rather than recall		9/10	
 Users have to remember to press the burger menu, but then have easy recognition between states.

Flexibility and efficiency of use	7/10	
Users can swipe certain menus for faster access, and hide elements they don’t need.

Aesthetic and minimalist design	9/10	
Visual design is consistent and can hide unneeded elements

Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors	1/10	
No error messages.

Help and documentation	1/10 	
No tutorials

Summary in three points:
1:	Standards and familiarity	10/10
2:	User's usage and efficiency.	5/10
3:	Aesthetic.			8/10

Strategy/Tactics AR-powered game

Visibility of system status	10/10
Each state is clearly labeled at the top of the screen.

Match between system and the real world	7/10	
Some jargon is used but it’s more game-specific than developer-specific.

User control and freedom	8/10	
All screens have a back button, but no undo button due to the nature of it being a game.

Consistency and standards	8/10	
Words are used with consistent meaning, UI follows a similar menu flow of other games.

Error prevention	3/10	
Hard to grade due to its nature as a game, slips are going to be commonplace.

Recognition rather than recall		8/10	
Both symbols and words are used for buttons and it isn’t too word-filled.

Flexibility and efficiency of use	1/10	
No way to customize and no shortcuts, or hide elements they don’t need

Aesthetic and minimalist design	7/10	
Not very minimalist because it’s a game, but does keep the UI to a minimum when content is on screen.

Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors	3/10	
One error message on the battle screen.

Help and documentation	1/10 	
No tutorial.

Summary in three points:
1:	Standards and familiarity	8/10
2:	User's usage and efficiency.	4/10
3:	Aesthetic.			8/10
